# Jason's Tees

This project is the new Angular driven front-end to my [jasons-tees-backend](https://github.com/selfVSmind/jasons-tees-backend) project. 

## A work in progress

This is still very much a work in progress, however, most of the original features are here and look better than ever thanks to the Angular Material modules! If you are interested in the Ebay functionality, you'll have to use the original version still. All of that work is already done on the back end, however, so it shouldn't be long before I delete these sentences. [The almost complete angular build is live here](https://t-shirts.jasonlambert.io/about).

## The old version is still there

You can still use the [old vanilla javascript version of tshirt-ebay-lister here](https://t-shirts.jasonlambert.io/old-version). Please keep in mind that the old version is more or less abandoned at this point, so if anything feels unfinished, it probably is.
