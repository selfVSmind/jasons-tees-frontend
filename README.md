# Jason's Tees

This project is the new Angular driven front-end to my [tshirt-ebay-lister](https://github.com/selfVSmind/tshirt-ebay-lister) project. 

## The old version is still there

You can still use the old vanilla javascript version of tshirt-ebay-lister [here](https://t-shirts.jasonlambert.io/old-version). Please keep in mind that the old version is more or less abandoned at this point, so if anything feels unfinished, it probably is.
