My business model involved me creating custom graphics on heat transfer vinyl, then applying them to a blank t-shirt. The problem was that ebay had no way of knowing that I was using the same inventory of size small black t-shirts, for example, for about 20 different listings. If I sold one small black t-shirt, I would have to manually update every listing that used that shirt. Ebay's listing tools just weren't cutting it. Once I had more than a handful of designs for sale, updating the prices and inventory counts was genuinely very frustrating and slow." },

For the backend, I'm running a NodeJS express server.
